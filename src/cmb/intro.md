# Computational Methods for Bioinformatics

## Course Overview

**Total Lectures:** 14  
**Exam Format:** Writing/debugging and discussing code (on paper or IDE)

## What This Course Is Really About

Solving problems. Not just any problems—2D and 3D problems that show up constantly in bioinformatics.

But here's the key: it's not about *if* you can solve it. It's about *how* you solve it.

**They hate brute force.** No nested loops. No "try everything and hope it works." Use the right data structures. Think before you code.

## The Real Skill

Choosing the appropriate data structure and algorithm for the problem. A smart approach beats a fast computer every time.

**Bad:** Loop inside a loop inside another loop (O(n³) nightmare)  
**Good:** Hash table + single pass (O(n) elegance)

## Practice Resources

**[Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/)** (focus until November 25th)  
Build practical skills through hands-on projects

**[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)**  
Practice problem-solving patterns, especially:
- Array/matrix manipulation (2D problems)
- Hash tables and sets
- Graph algorithms (for 3D structures)
- Dynamic programming basics

**Recommended pace:** Solve 2 problems for every lecture

## Study Strategy

1. **Understand the problem first** - Don't jump to coding
2. **Think about data structures** - What fits this problem naturally?
3. **Sketch the approach** - On paper, like you'll do in the exam
4. **Code it cleanly** - Readable beats clever
5. **Analyze complexity** - Can you do better than O(n²)?

## Exam Preparation

You'll write and debug code, then **discuss your choices**. They want to hear your reasoning:
- Why this data structure?
- What's the time complexity?
- Could you optimize it further?

Practice explaining your code out loud. If you can't articulate why you chose an approach, you probably don't understand it well enough.

**Remember:** In bioinformatics, you'll deal with sequences, structures, and massive datasets. Efficient algorithms aren't academic exercises—they're the difference between results in seconds versus days.
