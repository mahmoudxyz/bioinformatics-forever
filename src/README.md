# Welcome

Hello, I'm Mahmoud, and these are my notes. Since you're reading something I've written, I want to share a bit about how I approach learning and what you can expect here.

## My Philosophy

I believe there are no shortcuts to success. To me, success means respecting your time, and before investing that time, you need a plan rooted in where you want to go in life.

**Learn, learn, learn**, and when you think you've learned enough, write it down and share it.

## About These Notes

I don't strive for perfectionism. Sometimes I write something and hope someone will point out where I'm wrong so we can both learn from it. That's the beauty of sharing knowledge: it's a two-way street.

I tend to be pretty chill, and I occasionally throw in some sarcasm when it feels appropriate. These are my notes after all, so please don't be annoyed if you encounter something that doesn't resonate with you, just skip ahead.

I'm creating this resource purely out of love for sharing and teaching. Ironically, I'm learning more by organizing and explaining these concepts than I ever did just studying them. **Sharing is learning.** Imagine if scientists never shared their research, we'd still be in the dark ages.

## Final Thoughts

I have tremendous respect for everyone in this learning journey. We're all here trying to understand complex topics, and we all learn differently. If these notes help you even a little bit, then this project has served its purpose.
