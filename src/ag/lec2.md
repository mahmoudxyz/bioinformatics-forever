## Lecture 2: Applied Genomics Overview

### Key Concepts Covered

**Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium**  
Population genetics foundation - allele frequencies (p, q, r) in populations remain constant under specific conditions.

**Quantitative Genetics (QG)**  
Study of traits controlled by multiple genes. Used for calculating breeding values in agriculture and understanding complex human traits.

**The Human Genome**  
- ~3 billion base pairs
- <5% codes for proteins (the rest: regulatory, structural, "junk")
- Massive scale creates computational challenges

**QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci)**  
Genomic regions associated with quantitative traits - linking genotype to phenotype.

**Genomics Definition**  
Study of entire genomes - all DNA sequences, genes, and their interactions.

**Sequencing Accuracy**  
Modern sequencing: <1 error per 10,000 bases

**Comparative Genomics**  
Comparing genomes across species to understand evolution, function, and conservation.

**Applied Genomics (Why we're here)**  
**Analyze genomes and extract information** - turning raw sequence data into biological insights.

### Major Challenges in Genomic Data

1. **Storage** - Billions of bases = terabytes of data
2. **Transfer** - Moving large datasets between systems
3. **Processing** - Computational power for analysis

### Sequencing Direction Note

**Sanger sequencing:** Input = what you're reading (direct)  
**NGS:** Reverse problem - detect complement synthesis, infer template
