# Biomedical Databases

Hey! Welcome to my notes for the Biomedical Databases course where biology meets data engineering.

## Course Overview

**Total Lectures:** 14  
**Pace:** About 2 lectures per week  
**Structure:** The course is divided into modules, with the first module focusing on biological databases specifically.

<div class="warning">

Important Heads-Up 

The exam may be **split into two sessions** based on the modules. The first module is all about biological databases, so pay extra attention for right preparing.

## Supplementary Learning Resource

If you want to dive deeper into database fundamentals (and I mean *really* deep), check out:

**[CMU 15-445/645: Intro to Database Systems (Fall 2024)](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2024/)**

### About the CMU Course

This is one of the **best database courses available online**, taught by Andy Pavlo at Carnegie Mellon University. It's more advanced and assumes some C++ knowledge, but the explanations are incredibly clear.

**Recommended approach:**
- Watch about **2 CMU videos for every 1 lecture** we have
- Don't worry if you don't understand everything—it's graduate-level content
- Focus on the conceptual explanations rather than the C++ implementation details
- Use it to deepen your understanding, not as a replacement for our course

The CMU course covers database internals, query optimization, storage systems, and transaction management at a much deeper level. It's perfect if you're curious about how databases actually work under the hood.

## Study Strategy

Here's what works for me:

1. **Attend the lecture** and take rough notes
2. **Review and organize** the notes here within 24 hours (while it's fresh)
3. **Watch relevant CMU videos** for deeper understanding (optional but recommended)
4. **Practice with real databases** when applicable
5. **Connect concepts** between biological applications and database theory
